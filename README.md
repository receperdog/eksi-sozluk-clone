# Getting Started

### The Idea Behind The App

This project is a clone of the popular Turkish forum website [eksisozluk.com](https://eksisozluk.com/). 
The main idea behind the project is to create a forum website where users can create topics and add entries to these topics.
Users can also add comments to entries and like/dislike entries and comments. I will try to implement the most popular features of eksisozluk.com with using the technologies I have learned so far.

Tech Stack for Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, Maven, Git, Heroku and some core concepts of OOP and design patterns.
